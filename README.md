# ✨ Tailwind CSS Setup
The project is styled using Tailwind CSS, configured for simplicity and flexibility.

## Adding Custom Styles
To extend Tailwind’s default configuration, modify the tailwind.config.js file:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#4CAF50",
        secondary: "#FF5722",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
## Global Styles
Global styles are managed in ``index.css`` using Tailwind’s utility classes:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

# 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Integration with an API for real data handling.
- Role-based authentication and dashboard access.
- Enhanced accessibility and user experience.
- Improved form validation using libraries like react-hook-form.
